The `fellingdater` package provides a suite of functions
for dendrochronological and dendroarchaeological analysis, covering a workflow from tree-ring **data processing** and **crossdating**, up to
the estimation and reporting of **felling dates**. Originally designed to assist dendrochronologists in inferring felling dates from dated tree-ring
series with partially preserved sapwood, the package has been expanded
to include a workflow for tree-ring dating, analysis, and visualization.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of `fellingdater` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/fellingdater/) or
[R-universe](https://ropensci.r-universe.dev/fellingdater):

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ropensci/fellingdater")
```

or

``` r
install.packages("fellingdater", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

## Core functionality

### **Tree-ring series analysis (`trs_*` functions)**:

-   **Data generation and preparation**: Create synthetic datasets with
    `trs_pseudo_rwl()`, or read and prepare real data with `read_fh()`, `trs_select()`, `trs_remove()` and `trs_trim()`.

-   **Crossdating analysis**: Perform crossdating with `trs_crossdate()`
    and set end dates for the tree-ring series with `trs_date_end()`.

    The statistical measures in the crossdating procedure include:

    -   *t*-values according to [Hollstein
        (1980)](https://search.worldcat.org/de/title/899062584) and
        [Baillie & Pilcher (1973)](http://hdl.handle.net/10150/260029)
        transformation procedures (`trs_tho()`and `trs_tbp()`)

    -   percentage of parallel variation, including (Semi-)Synchronous
        Growth Changes (SGC and SSGC, [Visser
        2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/arcm.12600)), and
        *Gleichläufigkeit* ([Buras & Wilmking
        2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2015.03.003), [Eckstein &
        Bauch 1969](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02741777), [Huber
        1943](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02603303)) and associated
        significance level ([Jansma
        1995](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/45149))
        (`trs_pv()`)

    -   correlation measures, *r* Pearson and *t*-values (`trs_tSt()`)

-   **Visualization**: Display crossdating results with
    `trs_plot_dated()`, or individual series with `trs_plot_rwl()`

### **Felling date estimation ** (`sw_*` functions):

The package's primary focus is estimating felling dates from accurately
dated tree-ring series with preserved sapwood (*sw*). When the
bark/cambial zone (waney edge) is absent, the preserved sapwood rings
can be used to establish a date range for the felling event, allowing
researchers to report an interval in which the actual felling date
(*fd*) likely falls.

This procedure can be applied to individual series as well as to a
collection of related timbers.

-   **Individual series**: Estimate felling date ranges from tree-ring
    series with preserved sapwood.

-   **Group analysis**: Combine multiple samples assumed to be felled
    simultaneously for enhanced precision.

-   **Probability densities**: Work with sapwood probability
    distributions and create summed probability densities that reflect          dynamics in felling date intensity.

### Workflow

The package workflow progresses logically through:

1.  **Data preparation** - Generate synthetic data or prepare existing
    tree-ring measurements
2.  **Crossdating and statistical analysis** - Establish accurate
    calendar dates for tree-ring series
3.  **Quality control** - Validate dating results using multiple
    statistical measures
4.  **Felling date estimation** - Apply sapwood models to dated series
    with preserved sapwood
5.  **Grouping** - Combine individual felling date estimates for related        wooden finds
6.  **Visualization and reporting** - Present results with
    publication-ready graphics

## Examples

### Felling date estimation

In the following example the combined felling date range for a set of
five dated tree-ring series is computed:

```{r basic-example}
library(fellingdater)

## a data set where all series have partially preserved sapwood:
sw_example1
```

```{r example}
sw_combine(sw_example1, plot = TRUE)
```

The light grey distributions shows felling date probability densities
for each individual series, while the dark grey distribution represents
the combined estimate for a common felling date.

The sapwood model used in the example above to estimate the felling date
range, was published by [Hollstein
(1980)](https://search.worldcat.org/nl/title/6391864):

```{r model_sapwood_counts, dpi=200}
sw_model("Hollstein_1980", plot = TRUE)
```

### Tree-ring series analysis

The package provides comprehensive tools for the tree-ring analysis
workflow:

- Generate synthetic tree-ring data for testing

```{r trs-example}
set.seed(1234)
trs <- trs_pseudo_rwl(n_series = 5, series_length = c(100, 150),
                      end_date = c(2000, 2025), related = TRUE,
                      prefix = "series_")

trs_plot_rwl(trs,
             color = c("tomato3", "navyblue", "forestgreen", "purple", "orange")
             )
```

- Crossdate a series against a reference series/chronology

```{r}
series <- trs |> trs_select("series_1", trim = TRUE)
reference <- trs |> trs_select("series_2")
cd_results <- trs_crossdate(series, reference, min_overlap = 50,
                            sliding = TRUE, top_n = 5, rank_by = "t_Ho")

cd_results
```

 - Visualize crossdating results
 
```{r}
series_dated <- trs_end_date(series, 2014)
trs_plot_dated(series_dated, reference, 
               zscore = TRUE, pv_highlight = TRUE)

```

tree-ring series originating from medieval timber constructions in
[Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges) (Belgium). The results of
