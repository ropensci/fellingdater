# fellingdater 1.1.0 (2025-06-05)

-   Fixes to ensure that a user-defined sapwood dataset can be used with all relevant functions (fd_report(), sw_combine() and sw_sum().

    These additional functions have been added to 'helper-functions.R' and integrated into fd_report(), sw_combine() and sw_sum().
-   The example data sets for testing sw_combine() and sw_sum() and fd_report() have been renamed from trs_example(1 to 7) to sw_example(1 to 7).
