Description: fellingdater provides a comprehensive suite of functions
  for dendrochronological  and dendroarchaeological analysis, covering a 
  workflow from tree-ring **data processing** and **crossdating**, up to 
  the estimation and reporting of **felling dates**. Originally designed
  to assist dendrochronologists in inferring felling dates from dated tree-ring
  series with partially preserved sapwood, the package has been expanded
  to include a workflow for tree-ring dating, analysis, and visualization.
