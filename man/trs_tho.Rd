\title{Compute Hollstein-style t-values between all series in two rwl-style data frames}
\usage{
trs_tho(x, y = NULL, min_overlap = 50, as_df = FALSE, transform = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame of test tree-ring series in \code{rwl} format (years as rownames,
series as columns). All columns must be numeric.}

\item{y}{A data frame of reference tree-ring series in \code{rwl} format. If \code{NULL},
uses \code{x} for self-comparison. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{min_overlap}{Integer. Minimum number of overlapping years required between
series pairs to compute t-values. Must be >= 3. Default is 50.}

\item{as_df}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns results in long-format data frame.
If \code{FALSE}, returns list of matrices. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{transform}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, applies Hollstein transformation (log growth ratios).
If \code{FALSE}, assumes input data is already transformed. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Depending on \code{as_df} parameter:
\itemize{
\item If \code{as_df = FALSE} (default): A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{t_Ho}: Matrix of Hollstein t-values with test series as rows, reference series as columns
\item \code{overlap}: Matrix of overlap counts (number of common years) with same dimensions
}
\item If \code{as_df = TRUE}: A data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{series}: Name of test series
\item \code{reference}: Name of reference series
\item \code{t_Ho}: Hollstein t-value
\item \code{overlap}: Number of overlapping years
}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates Hollstein (1980) t-values for all pairwise comparisons
between tree-ring series in two data frames, using log-transformed growth ratios.
The method computes year-to-year growth ratios and applies correlation-based
t-statistics for crossdating analysis.
}
\details{
The Hollstein method involves:
\enumerate{
\item Alignment of series by common years
\item Computation of log-transformed growth ratios: \eqn{100 \times \log_{10}(x_t / x_{t-1})}
\item Calculation of Pearson correlation between transformed series
\item Computation of t-statistic: \eqn{t = r \sqrt{n-3} / \sqrt{1-r^2}}
}

Where \eqn{n} is the number of overlapping observations (original years, not growth ratios).
The degrees of freedom are adjusted by subtracting 3 to account for the growth ratio transformation.

Negative correlations are set to 0, and perfect correlations (|r| ≥ 1) result
in infinite t-values to handle floating-point precision issues.

# Create sample data

# Compute t-values (data frame format)
result_df <- trs_tho(rwl_test, rwl_ref, min_overlap = 30, as_df = TRUE)

# Self-comparison within single dataset
self_comparison <- trs_tho(rwl_test, min_overlap = 40)
