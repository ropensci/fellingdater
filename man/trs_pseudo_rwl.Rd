\title{Create a pseudo-population of tree-ring series}
\usage{
trs_pseudo_rwl(
  n_series = 10,
  series_length = 100,
  end_date = 2024,
  related = TRUE,
  trend = NULL,
  neg_lin_param = -0.1,
  neg_exp_param = 0.05,
  ar = TRUE,
  ar_params = 0.7,
  mean_rw = 100,
  noise_sd = 8,
  common_signal_strength = 0.75,
  prefix = "trs_",
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_series}{Integer. Number of tree-ring series to generate.}

\item{series_length}{Numeric or numeric vector of length 2. If a single number,
all series have this fixed length. If a vector of two values, series lengths are
randomly sampled between the minimum and maximum values (inclusive).}

\item{end_date}{Numeric or numeric vector of length 2. If a single number, all
series end in this year. If a vector of two values, series end years are randomly
sampled within this range.}

\item{related}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, all series share a common growth pattern
(i.e., internally correlated). If \code{FALSE}, each series is generated independently.}

\item{trend}{Character. Type of trend to apply to series. Options: \code{"neg_lin"} for
a negative linear trend, \code{"neg_exp"} for a negative exponential trend, or \code{NULL} for no trend.}

\item{neg_lin_param}{Numeric. Slope for the linear decline (typically between -0.1 and -1.0).}

\item{neg_exp_param}{Numeric. Rate parameter for the exponential decline (typically between 0.01 and 0.1).}

\item{ar}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, adds autocorrelation using an AR model. Note: when \code{related = TRUE},
AR is applied to the common base signal; when \code{related = FALSE}, AR is applied to each series individually.}

\item{ar_params}{Numeric vector. Autoregressive coefficients (e.g., \code{c(0.8)}, or \code{c(0.6, 0.2)}).}

\item{mean_rw}{Numeric. Mean ring width around which the data is centered (default is 100).}

\item{noise_sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation of noise added to each series (default is 8).}

\item{common_signal_strength}{Numeric. Strength of common signal when \code{related = TRUE} (0-1).
Higher values produce higher inter-series correlations (rbar). Default 0.75 typically
produces rbar around 0.5-0.7, which is realistic for tree-ring chronologies.}

\item{prefix}{Character. Prefix used when naming each tree-ring series (default is \code{"trs_"}).}

\item{seed}{Numeric. Random seed for reproducible results. If \code{NULL}, no seed is set.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} of class \code{"rwl"}, with years as row names and each column
representing one synthetic tree-ring series.
}
\description{
Generates a synthetic tree-ring width dataset in \code{rwl} format,
suitable for testing crossdating and chronology construction methods.

# Basic usage
