\title{Detect synchronous growth changes between two tree-ring series ( helper for trs_plot_dated() )}
\usage{
sgc_for_plot(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{data.frame} with one column of ring-width values and years as row names.}

\item{y}{A \code{data.frame} with one column of ring-width values and years as row names.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with two columns:
\item{pv_logi}{Logical vector indicating synchronous growth changes (TRUE) or not (FALSE)}
\item{year}{Numeric vector of years corresponding to the logical values}
}
\description{
Identifies years when two tree-ring series show synchronous growth changes (SGC)
\itemize{
\item both increasing or both decreasing from the previous year. Based on the logic
used in trs_pv() for distinguishing between synchronous and semi-synchronous growth.
}
}
\details{
The function compares year-to-year growth direction changes between two series
using the same logic as trs_pv():
\itemize{
\item Synchronous Growth Changes (SGC): Both series change in the same direction (both + or both -)
\item Semi-synchronous/Asynchronous: One series changes while other doesn't, or they change in opposite directions
}

Only years with synchronous growth changes receive TRUE values.
Years with missing values in either series are marked as FALSE.
The first year cannot be evaluated (no previous year for comparison) and is marked as FALSE.
}
\examples{
# Create sample data
years <- 1950:1980
x <- data.frame(series1 = runif(length(years), 0.5, 2.0))
rownames(x) <- years
y <- data.frame(series2 = runif(length(years), 0.8, 1.8))
rownames(y) <- years

# Detect synchronous growth changes
sync_growth <- sgc_for_plot(x, y)
head(sync_growth)

}
