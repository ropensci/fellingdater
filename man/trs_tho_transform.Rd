\title{Pre-transform tree-ring series using Hollstein method}
\usage{
trs_tho_transform(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A rwl-style data frame with years as rownames and series as columns.
All columns must be numeric.}
}
\value{
A matrix of log-transformed growth ratios with the same dimensions
as the input. The first row (first year) is set to NA since no previous
year exists for ratio calculation. Row names match the input data.
}
\description{
Computes log-transformed growth ratios for tree-ring series following
the Hollstein (1980) method: \code{100 * log10(value_t / value_(t-1))}.
This transformation emphasizes year-to-year growth variations.
}
\details{
The Hollstein transformation computes year-to-year growth ratios:

\deqn{G_t = 100 \times \log_{10}(x_t / x_{t-1})}

where \eqn{x_t} is the ring width at year \eqn{t}. This transformation:
\itemize{
\item Emphasizes relative changes between consecutive years
\item Reduces the influence of long-term trends
\item Makes series more suitable for crossdating analysis
}

Values that would result in undefined logarithms (zero or negative ratios)
are set to NA. The first year of each series is always NA since no
previous year exists for ratio calculation.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create sample rwl data
rwl_data <- trs_pseudo_rwl(n_series = 3, series_length = 50, end_date = 2020)

# Apply Hollstein transformation
transformed <- trs_tho_transform(rwl_data)

# Check dimensions (should be one row fewer)
nrow(rwl_data) # Original rows
nrow(transformed) # One fewer row

# View first few transformed values
head(transformed)
